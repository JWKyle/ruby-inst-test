    My workflow can improve a few different ways.  Occasionally I'll get so in zoned in on trying to figure out a problem, my code indents become dis-aligned.  It would probably be more beneficial to take a break from trying to tweak the code, and then make sure my indents are set properly.  Not only would this help in the long term, but it could help give me fresh eyes on the current challenge.

    Another way I could improve is to test my code more frequently.  I'll get trapped a little bit with I'm typing code I'm really confident in, and bypass the execution.  Occasionally, I'll mistype something, then get pulled out of my flow to track it down to fix.  Of course, as I continue to read bugs, that will also be helpful in tracking down my errors.
